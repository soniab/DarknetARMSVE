Download NNPACK and build. Then download the DarknetARMSVE repository.

Note: Please note that it is necessary to first build NNPACK for SVE architecture and create the static library. 


After building the NNPACK and create the static library, please follow the below instructions:
Enter in the repository by using `cd DarknetARMSVE`
Step 1: Please enable the macro by uncommenting
#define NNPACK 1
from include/darknet.h
Step 2: Please use MAkefile_NNPACK from makefiles to compile the software with winograd implementation. 
Step 3: Please change the path of the compiler and static NNPACK libraries if necessary. 
Step 4: hen compile the darknet using `make` command 
Step 5: This will create the static binary 


Executable:
The generated binary has been tested on A64FX, ARMIE and GEM5 simulator for SVE environment with 512, 1024, 2048 bit vector lengths.
